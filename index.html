              <span class="drop-cap">O</span> Summer, where hath thou been all
              this time?<br />
              Welcome ye, the giver of goods to all. <br />
              Food to all Nature in its Godly prime.<br />
              <br />
              Dearest of mother Nature gives her call<br />
              For the effects of your absent hath toilr&rsquo;d<br />
              Her. And her power took a mighty fall<br />
              <br />
              Stay long! For you are nigh everywhere hail&rsquo;d<br />
              Save for those who can&rsquo;t stand your lofty might<br />
              And in their eyes thou art a danger veiled<br />
              <br />
              Thy effects to Nature give beauty sight<br />
              In your time should it never ever rain<br />
              And ruin thee by sending you on a fright<br />
              <br />
              What earthly use will the world ever gain,<br />
              Ah, where thou art not must be full of pain.<br />

              Summer&rsquo;s fruits<br />
              That she doth kindly give us underlings<br />
              She may not feed and nourish Nature&rsquo;s roots<br />
              <br />
              Like Water, of whose praise may I not sing<br />
              For he already hath his praise wide rife<br />
              Summer doth power to all the trees bring<br />
              <br />
              And by that process make food for all life<br />
              Bring warmth to all, for she is temperate<br />
              Yet mild in her delicacies of strife<br />
              <br />
              Between herself and the people who hate<br />
              For some reason the pleasantness of her.<br />
              Don&rsquo;t blame, for God hath decided her fate<br />
              <br />
              Human, listen! Act wiser to the fair<br />
              Summer, for she adds to the world her flair.<br />

              <span class="drop-cap">O</span> Summer, thou truly art a poet's
              muse<br />
              Those who fail to praise thee do not see thy&#160;<br />
              Glory large in its full fledged form let loose<br />
              <br />
              Show mercy! To those with wings wide stretched fly.<br />
              Be kind ye! To oceans and seas that frets<br />
              Into sightless air with a mistress' shy<br />
              <br />
              With just a look of thy boldness life sweats<br />
              Begone, ye wet marsh lands of humid grime<br />
              With dry lands of lone sand there's no regrets<br />
              <br />
              Yet, be kinder to lands of sandy prime<br />
              Shine! But with far less temperate readings<br />
              Give them the dearest of your ticking time<br />
              <br />
              If God be the one to read these musings<br />
              Hear! And make Summer adhere my writings<br />

              <span class="drop-cap">T</span>he great Aesop did write in full
              the true<br />
              Wonders thou art capable of doing<br />
              And the same I put forth here for thy view<br />
              <br />
              The northwind had a fight with sun brewing<br />
              Who's stronger? The one that strew'd everything<br />
              Or the hot sun that kept all world glowing<br />
              <br />
              Yet a challenge then did the northwind bring<br />
              Who strips with ease first the traveller's cloak&#160;<br />
              By all means be crowned as the mighty king<br />
              <br />
              So the northwind with all his might provoke<br />
              But the man pulled his cloak and did not yield<br />
              Yet mild rays of sun did make him uncloak<br />
              <br />
              The cloak that acted against wind as shield<br />
              To the gentle sun he himself be veiled&#160;<br />

              <span class="drop-cap">O</span> Summer, thou gifter of perspired
              pearls!<br />
              I beg ye mighty for the following<br />
              Favours, which if be sans the Earth it fails!<br />
              <br />
              The two poles of North and South there&rsquo;s flowing<br />
              Water and the white icecaps abound<br />
              Everywhere, shine mild to keep it glowing<br />
              <br />
              Beam lighter, if the ground is not too drowned<br />
              For thirsty mouths with thine power gleaming<br />
              They could but get to any place around<br />
              <br />
              What if all this be a pleasure dreaming<br />
              And if you be gone, I wonder when you<br />
              Are then absent, and at last your beaming&#160;<br />
              <br />
              Stops. I live in hopes, for even the blue,<br />
              Winter still has a sunny day or two.<br />
