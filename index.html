    I
    
    O Summer, where hath thou been all this time?
    Welcome ye, the giver of goods to all.
    Food to all Nature in its Godly prime.
    
    Dearest of mother Nature gives her call
    For the effects of your absent hath toil’d 
    Her. And her power took a mighty fall
    
    Stay long! For you are nigh everywhere hail’d
    Save for those who can’t stand your lofty might
    And in their eyes thou art a danger veiled
    
    Thy effects to Nature give beauty sight
    In your time should it never ever rain
    And ruin thee by sending you on a fright
    
    What earthly use will the world ever gain,
    Ah, where thou art not must be full of pain.
    
    II
    
    Now shall I deviate and list Summer’s fruits
    That she doth kindly give us underlings
    She may not feed and nourish Nature’s roots
    
    Like Water, of whose praise may I not sing
    For he already hath his praise wide rife
    Summer doth power to all the trees bring
    
    And by that process make food for all life
    Bring warmth to all, for she is temperate
    Yet mild in her delicacies of strife
    
    Between herself and the people who hate
    For some reason the pleasantness of her.
    Don’t blame, for God hath decided her fate
    
    Human, listen! Act wiser to the fair
    Summer, for she adds to the world her flair.
    
    III
    
    O Summer, thou truly art a poet's muse
    Those who fail to praise thee do not see thy 
    Glory large in its full fledged form let loose
    
    Show mercy! To those with wings wide stretched fly.
    Be kind ye! To oceans and seas that frets
    Into sightless air with a mistress' shy
    
    With just a look of thy boldness life sweats
    Begone, ye wet marsh lands of humid grime
    With dry lands of lone sand there's no regrets
    
    Yet, be kinder to lands of sandy prime
    Shine! But with far less temperate readings
    Give them the dearest of your ticking time
    
    If God be the one to read these musings
    Hear! And make Summer adhere my writings
    
    IV
    
    The great Aesop did write in full the true
    Wonders thou art capable of doing
    And the same I put forth here for thy view
    
    The northwind had a fight with sun brewing
    Who's stronger? The one that strew'd everything
    Or the hot sun that kept all world glowing
    
    Yet a challenge then did the northwind bring
    Who strips with ease first the traveller's cloak 
    By all means be crowned as the mighty king
    
    So the northwind with all his might provoke
    But the man pulled his cloak and did not yield
    Yet mild rays of sun did make him uncloak
    
    The cloak that acted against wind as shield
    To the gentle sun he himself be veiled 
    
    V
    
    O Summer, thou gifter of perspired pearls!
    I beg ye mighty for the following
    Favours, which if be sans the Earth it fails!
    
    The two poles of North and South there’s flowing
    Water and the white icecaps abound
    Everywhere, shine mild to keep it glowing
    
    Beam lighter, if the ground is not too drowned
    For thirsty mouths with thine power gleaming
    They could but get to any place around
    
    What if all this be a pleasure dreaming
    And if you be gone, I wonder when you
    Are then absent, and at last your beaming 
    
    Stops. I live in hopes, for even the blue,
    Winter still has a sunny day or two.
